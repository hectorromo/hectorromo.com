SASS and CSS
We use SASS and Bourbon (http://bourbon.io/) for our resources. If you don't use SASS, just use
the .css files that you find in the css folder. You can delete both sass and partials folders.
We have integrated Eric Meyerâ€™s CSS reset rules (http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) and
Modernizr (http://modernizr.com/).
